# Natural Language Processing Projects - Verona University

This repository showcases  Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects completed during the  NLP course at Verona University. These projects demonstrate practical applications of  NLP techniques in real-world scenarios.

## Project 1 - Wikipedia-based Text Classification System

### Overview
This project involved developing a  classification system that can differentiate between geographic and non-geographic textual content. The implementation leverages modern Python libraries alongside NLTK, incorporating various text preprocessing strategies to optimize classification accuracy.


## Project 2 - Hierarchical Document Summarization

### Overview
This project focused on creating an intelligent summarization system capable of generating concise summaries while preserving the stylistic elements of reference texts. The implementation addresses the practical challenge of summarizing documents that exceed typical context window limitations.
